#this is just a large dictionary
#print = prints it into whatever is running the program... powershell here
# # = a pound or octothorp
# + adds
# - subtracts
# / divides
# * multiplies
# % returns a remainder
# == returns true or false if equal to
# < returns true or false for if less than
# > returns true or false for if greater than
# <= returns true or false for if less than or equal to
# >= returns true or false for if greater than or equal to
# there is no sympbol for this, but it represents a varriable that gets assigned a value
# 3 is an integer
# 3.5 is a float
# 'this is a string'
# %s inserts string
# %d inserts integer
# %r inserts raw 
# %f inserts float
# 'this is the format to insert a thing %s' %s
# you can multiply characters when you print... wooo
# ''' this lets you do multiple lines of strings '''
# \n is a line break
# \t is a tab
# \b is a backspace
# python 2 uses raw_input but python 3 uses input
# from sys import argv requires a subsequent line that defines the args such as script, x, y = argv. the user then needs those arguments after python when launching
# setting a variable equal to open(file_name) allows you to use said variable to read and shit.
# you can modify open with , 'w' for pure and write 'a' for addem and 'r+' for read and write. it by default is 'r' for read
# filename_variable.read() reads the file
# filename_variable.write('this writes shit')
# filename_variable.close() closes the file
# filename_variable.truncate() wipes the file, but idk why you'd use it.
# len(filename_variable) tells you the size of it in bytes
# def(var1, var2, var3): is how you make scripts/functions (more than 5 var is uncouth)
# files read in 1 direction so if you need to go back and do shit you need to filename_variable.seek(0)
# file_name.readline() prints out the line you're on and goes to the next one
# functions finish inside out, so when you nest functions, you have to resolve the inside shit to know what the values are going to be for the outside functions\
