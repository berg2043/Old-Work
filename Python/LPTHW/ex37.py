#learning key words
#Keywords
# and = tests for two trues otherwise false
# del = deletes a variable
# from = is used to import shit that specific to a module. it really prevents the requirment of naming the module everytime you call a function
# not = reverses true or false statment
# while = while this is true, your shit underneath repeats
# as = assigns values for things you just called upon in the statement
# elif = else if
# global = it sets a value to the following variable that is recognized by things outside of the function
# or = tests for at least one true otherwise false
# with = as far as i can tell, it limits what you're doing to just that thing.  i've only really seen it open up a file do something to it and close it
# assert = as far as i can tell, it is used for debugging
# else = when all if and elifs fail
# if = if it's true the rest happens
# pass = literally just passes the code through. used as a placeholder i guess
# yield = stops a program to send out a value. it almost just suspends it to do so since it can pick right back up
# break = stops whatever it's nested in
# except = this is what happens when a try statement hits an error
# import = imports a module
# print = prints things to the command line
# class = a complicated thing. its how i conceptualize data.  Think of it like a class in a game where when somehting is assigned it it also gets a bunch of other empty varaibles
# exec = executes thing. files. all that jazz... you're probably better off using a subprocess though imo
# in = defines the list that for runs through
# raise = raises the statement as a part of error handling
# continue = continues the next interation in the loop. i guess its how you prevent it from just stopping
# finally = always executes after try statement
# is = checks to see is the identity is the same. similar to == but == just checks the values to see if they are are equal
# return = if something calls for a function this is returned.  usefull for using functioned to define variables
# def = defines a function
# for = runs through a list defined by in
# lambda = is used to define an unnamed function... weird lol
# try = literally tries what's within it and runs to the except if an error occurs

#String Escape Sequences
# \\ = \
# \' = '
# \" = "
# \a beeping noise?
# \b backspace
# \f = new page
# \n = new line
# \r = return (hardly used though) (guess it brings it back to the begining of the line)
# \t = tab
# \v = it was used to make a printer print faster by pushing the page out by a tab lol

#String Formats
# %d = integer
# %i = integer
# %o = octaldecimal
# %u = unsigned decimal ?
# %x = hexidecimal with lower case above 9
# %X = hexidecimal with upper case above 9
# %e = scientific notation w/ up to 6 decimals
# %E = scientific notation using E w/ up to 6 decimals
# %f = fixed point number w/ up to 6 decimals
# %F = fixed point number but letters get caps like INF w/ up to 6 decimals
# %g = general format w/ up to 6 decimals (probably most used tbh
# %G = same as g except switched to %E when numbers get too big (i like this one)
# %c = converts number to character
# %r = raw
# %s = string
# %% = percentage

#Operators
# + = addition
# - = subtraction
# * = multiplication
# ** = exponent
# / = division
# // = division rounded to 0
# % = gives you the remainder of imaginary division
# < = less than
# > = greater than
# <= = less than or equal to
# >= = greater than or equal to
# == = equal to
# != = not equal to
# <> = not equal to
# ( ) = imo this is just how you group things lol (i guess this also identifies functions)
# [ ] = creates a list
# { } = replacement field. whatever is in it gets replaced
# @ = used to modify a function or object
# , = forms a tuple or finite list
# : = identifies keys in directories
# . = makes the following do its action on the preceeding
# = = sets the variable value
# ; = delimits lines but uncessesary, really useful to add code to comments
# += = adds following to previous
# -= = subtracts following from previous
# *= = multiplies the two
# /= = divides the previous by the following
# // = does // the previous by the following
# %= = returns the remainder of the prvious/following
# ** = previous to the power of the following
